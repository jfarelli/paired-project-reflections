## Paired Project Reflections - "Hangin' In There"

**1. In a few sentences, explain what the project was and the scope of your work.**

* In our second week at [Turing](https://turing.edu/), in the Front End Program we were paired together for a project that encompassed the languages of  Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
* Our goal as a team was to create a functional motivational website that would give the user access to different motivational posters,   be able to create their own, and also have the ability to save their selections.
<br>

**2. What role do you typically play on a team?**

* Typically, I like to be the lead, however, since this was our first paired project, and we were both new to these concepts, we each switched off working on different portions of this project. I handled some of the button functionality with moving from the main page to the **"Poster Creation Form"**, being able to save the posters with the **"Save This Poster"** button, and being able to see a different poster with the **"Show Another Random Poster"** button.
* We each took turns with writing the Js code that provided functionality when creating a new poster, being able to view that poster with the **"Show My Poster"** button, and the ability to save the selections with the **"Save This Poster"** button.  
* There were several functions written within Js in order to be able to view, and also store saved posters without creating duplicates.
<br>

**3. What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?**

* We worked hand-in-hand with being able to delete a saved poster by double-clicking on the poster. This function proved to be one of the more challenging in the project, as we had not worked previously with the method.
* We each dug around our class notes, as well as the internet for references on how to solve this problem. We also called in a mentor to help us break-down the problem for us, so that we can think about it from a more seasoned way of thinking.
* After several trial and error situations (and a good amount of frustration) we came to the correct conclusion as to how to implement this method and make it work properly. And it finally worked!
<br>

**4. What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project?**

* Working with another personality brings its own challenges. However, one thing we did well was that we came together before we wrote any code and talked the project through: Our expectations, what the functionality could look like, and established norms for workflow and breaks.
* Always listen to your partner and make sure you're heard as well. We had several frustrating times when functions within our code wouldn't work. When we hit those roadblocks, we'd take a step back and take a breather instead of pounding on which, more often than not, breeds greater frustration with the project, and also your partner.
<br>

**5. What is one technical takeaway from this project?**

* Working through this project without a full knowledge of what we were doing caused us to research new methods to handle different situations. It created a better understanding of what goes into the functionality of the code you write. While you may have an idea of how it will workin your head, it's often difficult to put the thoughts into functional code if you're not a seasoned coder.
* Working through these issues and researching the proper methods instilled a better learning mentality; since you're often not going to remember exactly how a function, or a function within a function is going to work.
<br>

**6. Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?**

* Better prep work. While we completed this project after only two weeks into this course, there's always more prep that could be done.
* During the initial prep phase with future teammates, I would want to talk through what methods we think will be used within the program and do some more initial prep work in researching and getting, at lease, a base understanding if these methods come up.
