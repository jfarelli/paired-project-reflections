## Paired Project Reflections - "Hangin' In There"

**1. In a few sentences, explain what the project was and the scope of your work.**

* In our second week at [Turing](https://turing.edu/), in the Front End Program we were paired together for a project that encompassed the languages of  Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
* Our goal as a team was to create a functional motivational website that would give the user access to different motivational posters,   be able to create their own, and also have the ability to save their selections.
<br>

**2. What role do you typically play on a team?**

* Typically, I like to be the lead, however, since this was our first paired project, and we were both new to these concepts, we each switched off working on different portions of this project. I handled some of the button functionality with moving from the main page to the **"Poster Creation Form"**, being able to save the posters with the **"Save This Poster"** button, and being able to see a different poster with the **"Show Another Random Poster"** button.
* We each took turns with writing the Js code that provided functionality when creating a new poster, being able to view that poster with the **"Show My Poster"** button, and the ability to save the selections with the **"Save This Poster"** button.  
* There were several functions written within Js in order to be able to view, and also store saved posters without creating duplicates.
<br>

**3. What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?**

* We worked hand-in-hand with being able to delete a saved poster by double-clicking on the poster. This function proved to be one of the more challenging in the project, as we had not worked previously with the method.
* We each dug around our class notes, as well as the internet for references on how to solve this problem. We also called in a mentor to help us break-down the problem for us, so that we can think about it from a more seasoned way of thinking.
* After several trial and error situations (and a good amount of frustration) we came to the correct conclusion as to how to implement this method and make it work properly. And it finally worked!
<br>

**4. What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project?**

* Working with another personality brings its own challenges. However, one thing we did well was that we came together before we wrote any code and talked the project through: Our expectations, what the functionality could look like, and established norms for workflow and breaks.
* Always listen to your partner and make sure you're heard as well. We had several frustrating times when functions within our code wouldn't work. When we hit those roadblocks, we'd take a step back and take a breather instead of pounding on which, more often than not, breeds greater frustration with the project, and also your partner.
<br>

**5. What is one technical takeaway from this project?**

* Working through this project without a full knowledge of what we were doing caused us to research new methods to handle different situations. It created a better understanding of what goes into the functionality of the code you write. While you may have an idea of how it will workin your head, it's often difficult to put the thoughts into functional code if you're not a seasoned coder.
* Working through these issues and researching the proper methods instilled a better learning mentality; since you're often not going to remember exactly how a function, or a function within a function is going to work.
<br>

**6. Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?**

* Better prep work. While we completed this project after only two weeks into this course, there's always more prep that could be done.
* During the initial prep phase with future teammates, I would want to talk through what methods we think will be used within the program and do some more initial prep work in researching and getting, at lease, a base understanding if these methods come up.

## Group Project Reflections - "IdeaBox"

**1. In a few sentences, explain what the project was and the scope of your work.**

* The IdeaBox project made use of creating elements (Idea Cards) by typing text into a Title and a Body input and displaying the cards after the save button was clicked. Once the cards were created, the user has the option to star (favorite), or delete the cards. Once starred, those favorited cards were made visible by clicking another button and then the user could be returned to the main page w/ all ideas when clicking the same button used to view the favorited cards.
* In this project I contributed to writing the basic HTML and CSS to get the ball rolling, and worked with my other team members to create the comp before moving on to the functionality. 
* I handled different funcionalities throughout the project: 
    - I worked on a filter method that filtered through the cards when typing into the search input area. 
    - I also worked on functionality w/ having the save button disabled unless text was inputed into the Title and Body input fields, and then re-deactivating the save button after the card was created. Within this I worked w/ my team on clearing the Title and Body inputs after the save button was clicked.
    - I also worked on changing the "Show Starred Ideas" button text to "Show All Ideas" once clicked and then reverting it back to the original text once clicked again. This functionality was inserted into a larger function that was created by my other team members to show the favorited ideas once the button was clicked. 

**3. What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?**

* Working on the `filterSearch()` method was a challenge. I did a lot of research on different sites and finally found an example on W3 schools to reference. I read through their function several times to understand what was going on and then wrote the function based on our code...and it sure didn't work right away. There was a lot of trial and error on my end, but after riding the struggle bus, I took it to my team where we broke it down several times to find the issue, and after a good amount of time spent, we finally figured it out! That was one of those jump out of your seat moments, for sure!

**4. What is one personal/professional takeaway from this project?**

* On the paried project, we worked hand-in-hand, so I was used to that. However, on this project, we did a divide and conquer approach. That was a little scary at first and definitely had me frustrated, BUT working through functionality on our own and then coming back, showing our seperate code and how we approached it, and them coming together to break it down, fix it, and then implement it was highly beneficial for my learning. 
* Personally, I liked the divide and conquer approach, as I'm sure it's used all over in the workplace. However, getting those merge conflicts was both a stressful moment, but also a nice teachable moment to make sure you're deciding on naming conventions as a team, instead of going off the rails.

**5. What is one technical takeaway from this project?**

* Working on small pieces at a time. Writing a basic HTML layout, then going to your CSS to style that out. After that, going back and forth between your HTML & CSS to add elements little by litte and then style them in smaller steps. This helps me, becasue I've always approached with the notion that I need my WHOLE HTML written out before I start to style. Now, I know better.
* Seeing how the innerHTML was generated to produce new cards within the main.js file, instead of hard-coding into the hmtl.index file. 
* How we can work on seperate functionalities and then be able to combine into the other teams code.
* Working through bugs. I don't typically pseudocode, but becasue of this project I now do. It helps writing down what's supposed to happen within the function and what the expected outcome should be, that way you have a step-by-step guide of what you need to write. Then, you just have to figure out how to write it.

**6. Based on these takeaways, what is something you want to focus on for the next project?**

* Working on smaller pieces when building the HTML and then styling w/ CSS. Creating a basic shell. Style that shell. Then, go back and add more details piece-by-piece, and then style those pieces. "Small steps still climb mountains."
